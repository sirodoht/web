        <p>
            <strong>Background</strong>
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>I have 10+ years of experience working as a software engineer</strong> at
                technology startups across energy, biotech/medtech, fintech (and other)
                industries. Also, I spend (and have been spending for the last 5 years)
                some hours of my week working in the education industry and in book
                publishing and digital publishing (nonfiction and scientific).
            </li>
            <li>
                My work is intentional towards users and user experience. I define
                problems from the user perspective and work towards solving problems
                with the user's benefit in mind.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lately, I've been focusing on helping companies establish robust data
                engineering infrastructure and end-to-end workflows for ML/DL processes.
                Additionally, I contribute in defining and refining operational processes,
                including team structure, hiring strategies, and product development
                workflows.

        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                I write clean, maintainable, testable, performant code and I build
                UX-first, secure, scalable, and extensible applications and services.
                GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/sirodoht">github.com/sirodoht</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>I am deeply familiar with the Python programming language</strong> and the
                Django web framework. I'm also broadly familiar with the Python
                ecosystem and most of its most popular libraries across both the
                scientific domain (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, spaCy, OpenCV, Pillow,
                et al) and the web domain (Flask, FastAPI, Graphene GraphQL, SQLAlchemy,
                Alembic, et al).
            </li>
            <li>
                I have worked extensively in cloud infrastructure with providers such
                as AWS, GCP, and Cloudflare, with systems such as Kubernetes, and with
                tools such as Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Apache Airflow.
            </li>
            <li>
                I have a lot of experience working with the JavaScript and Node.js
                ecosystem. I dabble in Go, Rust, and Ruby. I am well-versed in the
                latest developments around Artificial Intelligence and Large Language
                Models: experienced with OpenAI's and Anthropic's APIs, fine-tuning of
                quantized models, local inference using ollama and llama.cpp.
            </li>
            <li>
                I have been involved in various open source projects since 2011. I have
                built and maintain (since 2020) an open source AGPL-licensed niche blogging platform
                called Mataroa:
                <a href="https://github.com/mataroa-blog/mataroa">github.com/mataroa-blog/mataroa</a>.
                Mataroa is a sustainable profitable business with 150+ paying users.

        <p>
            <strong>I always want to learn.</strong> Which is why I try to avoid thinking that I know,
            as I have found this mindset to be problematic for acquiring new knowledge
            and improving. I like to think I am a beginner in everything and convince
            myself with the beginner's mind, even though I need to convince people to
            hire me too — which can be paradoxical.
        </p>

        <div style="border-left: 8px solid #3D6D75B8;">
            <blockquote style="margin: 16px 16px;">
                <p>
                    In the beginner’s mind there is no thought, “I have attained
                    something.” All self-centered&nbsp;thoughts  limit our vast mind.
                    When we have no thought of achievement, no thought  of self, we
                    are true beginners. Then we can really learn something.

            <strong>Work Philosophy</strong>
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                I work with speed in mind (but never at the expense of quality or
                security). In the last 10 years I have joined more than 15 separate
                teams of software and infrastructure engineers. This background has
                equiped me with skills that enable me to fairly quickly become familiar
                with new codebases and architectures. Upon joining a team, my primary
                objective is to learn how to collaborate and communicate with the team
                effectively, with the goal of submitting a PR by the second day.
            </li>
            <li>
                I join teams gradually to facilitate minimal risk for the hiring manager
                (and myself). I start with 2 days per week, and grow to 5 days after 1
                or 2 months.
            </li>
            <li>
                I post a report (usually in the form of a written
                standup) for every day that I work, outlining the content of my work.
                <strong>I do not accept payment unless there is complete satisfaction</strong>
                with my work from the stakeholders. This is achieved through clear, structured,
                and relevant communication between me, the team, the stakeholders.
            <li>
                My daily rate is $1,000. I provide invoices at the end of each month,
                with payment terms requiring settlement within 30 days.
            </li>
        </ol>

                    Theo worked briefly for us as a freelancer before we
                    employed him on a permanent contract. He completed an
                    apprenticeship in Level 7 Artificial Intelligence in
                    addition to working on multiple projects with Animorph.
                    He's an excellent member of a team, is thoughtful and
                    considerate, can explain his reasoning well, and is great
                    at teaching and learning together. He will be missed!

                    Theo is an excellent engineer. Sure he knows his stuff: we
                    threw him into the deep end on a bunch of different
                    projects with different frameworks and deployment
                    strategies and he didn't even blink. More importantly
                    though, he approached each problem with patience and
                    humility, checking in on technical direction as well as
                    business need regularly. I'd hire him again in a
                    heartbeat.

                    I had the opportunity to work closely with Theodore at
                    Numan. Theodore brings with him a massive amount of
                    knowledge, passion and kindness. Always willing to go the
                    extra mile, he created outside of the scope of our sprints
                    an amazing tool for our clinician that will allow saving an
                    incredible amount of time! It was an amazing experience
