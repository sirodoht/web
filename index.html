        <h1>Hi, I’m Theodore.</h1>

        <p>
            I’m interested in figuring out how we can make high quality software
            that is fast and simple.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hire me through
            <a href="https://zfraenkel.com/">Zermelo Fraenkel</a>
            for general software making or through
            <a href="https://animorph.coop/">Animorph</a>
            if you are specifically interested in software for medical devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            These days, I am:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Figuring out how to make a neural network library in
                <a href="http://call-cc.org/">Chicken Scheme</a>.
                Maybe SBCL is a better option?
            </li>
            <li>
                Reading the second edition of
                <a href="https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a>,
                a very hard but also highly compelling book in computer
                science and software systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Making a strictly 2D version of Super Hexagon in
                <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a>. I’m wondering
                if it’s a good idea to also make the chiptune soundtrack?
            </li>
        </ul>
