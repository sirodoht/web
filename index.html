        <h1>Hi, I’m Theodore.</h1>

        <p>
            I spend most of time trying to understand how we can make useful software.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some fun projects:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Figuring out how to make a neural network library in
                <a href="http://call-cc.org/">Chicken Scheme</a>.
                Is SBCL a better option?
            </li>
            <li>
                Reading the second edition of
                <a href="https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a>,
                a very hard but highly compelling book in computer science and
                software systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Making a strictly 2D version of Super Hexagon in
                <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a>. I want to write a
                chiptune soundtrack for it as well but I have zero idea on how
                to make music of any kind.
            </li>
        </ul>
