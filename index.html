            Most of the time, I'm trying to understand how we can make useful software.
            I think it needs to be fast and simple. I publish some of this work
            <a href="https://github.com/sirodoht">on GitHub</a>.

                    In the beginner’s mind there is no thought, “I have attained
                    something.” All self-centered&nbsp;thoughts  limit our vast mind.
                    When we have no thought of achievement, no thought  of self, we
                    are true beginners. Then we can really learn something.
